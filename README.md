# Fake mails
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning based mechanism for detection of fake news e-mails. <br>
First part of this project is focusing on web scraping of fake emails from a database made by Czech elves (Čeští elfové).<br>
Second part, that is under development right now, is a machine learning algorithm for detecting fake news emails.<br>
